/// create, rename, move — over years of documents, and that surface has six invariants of its own
/// to satisfy before it can be safe to aim at a real tree (ROADMAP 20). Naming the disagreement is
/// the half that is useful on its own and cannot do any harm.
///
/// The three states are distinct on purpose, and none of them borrows another's words: **no
/// profile** means the detectors have nothing to read, **no findings** means they ran and the tree
/// agrees with itself, and a list means it does not.
